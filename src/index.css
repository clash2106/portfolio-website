1. This creates the blink effect: invisible → visible → invisible.
2.  from → shorthand for 0% (start of the animation).
    to → shorthand for 100% (end of the animation).
    border-color: transparent → makes the right border invisible at the start and end of the animation.

/*
class you apply to the element (like <h1>) to combine the typing effect and the blinking caret.

1.whitewhite-space: nowrap; -> Prevents the text from wrapping to a new line.
2. Hides any text that extends beyond the container width.
3.Adds a right border to act as the blinking caret.
4.This line applies two animations at once.

1) typing 3s steps(30, end)
typing → another animation (usually defined in @keyframes typing) that increases the element’s width from 0 → 100%.
3s → total duration of the typing animation.
steps(30, end) → creates a stepwise progression, instead of smooth interpolation:
30 → number of steps (roughly the number of letters)
end → step completes at the end of each interval, making it look like letters appear one by one.

//the animation is divided into 5 discrete steps (because the word has 5 letters).
//This makes the letter appear instantly at the end of the step, instead of partially during the step.



2) blinkCaret 0.75s step-end infinite
blinkCaret → the blinking animation defined above.
0.75s → duration of one blink cycle.
step-end → ensures the jump between visible and invisible happens at the end of each step, giving a sharp blink instead of fading.
infinite → repeats the animation forever.
